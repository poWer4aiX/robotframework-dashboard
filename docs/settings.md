# Settings

RobotFramework Dashboard includes a fully customizable configuration system that controls how the dashboard looks and behaves.  

## General

The settings modal is divided into **five tabs**:

1. **Graphs** – general dashboard and chart behavior  
2. **Keywords** – which keyword libraries appear in keyword graphs  
3. **Overview** – controls for the Overview page layout and toggles  
4. **Theme** – custom color overrides for light and dark mode, plus custom title and logo branding  
5. **JSON** – direct editing of the full JSON config for advanced users  

## Theme Toggle

The dashboard can be displayed in **light mode** or **dark mode**.  
This setting is applied globally across all dashboard pages and graphs.
This can be set through the sun/moon icon in the menu bar.

## General Settings (Graphs Tab)

The **Graphs** tab contains the core configuration options for all charts in the dashboard. These settings influence how the dashboard is generated and how graphs are rendered.

### Details

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unified Dashboard Sections** | Show all dashboard sections in a single unified view. (Instead of run/suite/test/keyword separate) |
| **Display Legends** | Show or hide graph legends. Useful to disable this when graphs contain many series. |
| **Display Axis Titles** | Shows axis labels (e.g., *Run Time*, *Pass/Fail Count*). Disable for a cleaner look. |
| **Display Run Start/Alias Labels On Axes** | Enables labels directly on graph axes. Disable for a cleaner look. |
| **Run Label Display** | Controls which label is used to identify runs across graphs, tooltips, axes, and comparison selects. Three options are available: **Run Start** (default) — uses the raw `run_start` timestamp; **Alias** — uses the alias derived from the output filename (see [Aliases](/advanced-cli-examples#aliases-for-clean-dashboard-identification)); **Run Name** — uses the Robot Framework suite name recorded in the output file. When multiple runs share the same name, a numeric suffix is appended automatically (e.g. *Tests*, *Tests 2*, *Tests 3*). |
| **Display Prefixes** | Shows or hides the `project_` prefix text on Overview page tags. |
| **Display Milliseconds Run Start Labels** | Adds millisecond precision to run_start timestamps. |
| **Display Drawing Animations** | Enables animated graph rendering. |
| **Animation Duration (Milliseconds)** | Length of animation, e.g. `1500` ms. |
| **Bar Graph Edge Rounding (Pixels)** | Controls rounding of bar edges (e.g., `0` = square, `8` = softer). |
| **Display Timezone Offsets** | Show or hide the timezone offset suffix (e.g. `+02:00`) appended to `run_start` timestamps in graphs and tables. Only has a visible effect on runs that have a stored timezone offset. Runs without an offset are unchanged. |
| **Convert Timestamps to Local Timezone** | Converts stored `run_start` timestamps from their recorded timezone to the **viewer's browser timezone**. Only applies to runs that have a stored timezone offset — runs without an offset are left unchanged. Useful when runs were recorded in a different timezone than the person viewing the dashboard. |
| **Suite Statistics – Default suite selection (dropdown)** | Selects which suite(s) are shown by default in the Suite Statistics tab. Options: `All Suites Separate`, `All Suites Combined`, or any individual suite. If the selected suite is removed from the data, the first available suite is used automatically. |
| **Test Statistics – Default suite selection (dropdown)** | Selects which suite is shown by default in the Test Statistics tab. Options: `All` or any individual suite. If the selected suite is removed from the data, the first available suite is used automatically. |
| **Test Statistics – Load all suites by default** | When enabled (disabled by default) then the figures in the *Test Statistics* tab are generated from all suites, otherwise from the selected one only. This can impact the response time depending on the number of suites within the dashboard. |

## Keyword Settings (Keywords Tab)

The **Keywords** tab controls which libraries appear inside the Keyword Graphs.  
This allows you to include or exclude specific libraries based on your dashboard needs.

### Details

- A list of discovered libraries is shown  
- Each library has an **enable/disable toggle**  
- Disabled libraries will **not** appear in the keyword section

|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Latest Runs** | On | Show the Latest Runs bar displaying the most recent run per project with color-coded durations. |
| **Total Stats** | On | Show the Total Stats bar with aggregate pass/fail/skip counts and average pass rates across all runs per project. |
| **Projects by Name** | On | Group and display projects by their run name on the Overview. |
| **Projects by Tag** | Off | Group and display projects by custom `project_` tags. See [Project Tagging](/advanced-cli-examples#project-tagging). |
| **Display Prefixes** | On | Show the `project_` prefix text on tag-based project names. |
| **Percentage Filters** | On | Show the duration percentage threshold filter for color-coding run durations. |

## Theme Settings (Theme Tab)

The **Theme** tab allows you to override the default colors used by the dashboard in both light and dark modes, and to set custom branding (title and logo) for the menu bar. Each mode has independent color customization.

### Color Details

| Color | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Background** | The main page background color. |
| **Card** | The background color for graph cards and content panels. |
| **Highlight** | The accent color used for hover states and interactive elements. |
| **Text** | The primary text color across the dashboard. |

### Branding Details

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Custom Title** | A text label shown in the navigation bar next to the logo. Type any text to set it; leave blank to hide it. If `-t` / `--dashboardtitle` was set when generating the dashboard, that value takes **priority** and cannot be overridden from the UI. |
| **Custom Logo** | Upload a PNG image to replace the default Robot Framework logo in the navigation bar. Images of any size or aspect ratio are accepted — the image is automatically scaled and padded to a square so it fits neatly in the logo slot. The logo is also applied as the browser tab **favicon** (at 48 × 48 px). Click **Reset** to restore the default. |

### Usage

- Select **Light** or **Dark** mode to edit the colors for that theme  
- Use the color pickers to set custom values  
- Each color has a **Reset** button to restore its default value  
- Type into the **Custom Title** field to display a branded label in the menu bar  
- Upload a PNG via **Custom Logo** to replace the Robot Framework logo; click **Reset** to restore the default  
- Changes apply immediately — no need to close the modal  

### Saving Theme Settings

- Closing the modal **automatically saves** your theme selections  
- Theme colors and branding are stored in localStorage alongside other settings  
- Export via the JSON tab to share custom themes with your team

## Graph-Level Switches

In addition to the settings modal, individual graphs have their own toggle switches and dropdown filters (e.g. *Ignore Skips*, *Only Last Run*, *Only Failed Tests*, *Status*, *Only Changes*, *Hour*). These graph-level switches are **automatically saved to localStorage** and restored when the dashboard is reopened — your per-graph preferences are remembered across browser sessions.

See [Graphs & Tables – Graph Switch Persistence](/graphs-tables#graph-switch-persistence) for the full list of persisted switches and their defaults. All graph switches are stored under the `switch` key in the settings JSON.

## JSON Settings (JSON Tab)

For advanced use cases, you can directly edit the internal settings JSON.  
This allows complete control over:

- Section ordering  
- Graph ordering  
- Graph sizes  
- Switch toggles (including graph-level switches like *Ignore Skips*, *Only Last Run*, etc.)  
- Display toggles  
- Keyword configuration  
- Animation settings  
- Theme and visual preferences  

> **Tip:** See [Advanced CLI](/advanced-cli-examples.html#using-a-custom-dashboard-config-json) for sharing a default config with team members!

### Details

- The “Current Settings JSON” textfield shows the current configuration  
- You may edit it directly to modify any setting  
- Available options:
  - **Copy Settings JSON** — copies the settings JSON to clipboard
  - **Apply Settings JSON** — applies the content of the JSON box  
  - **Reset Settings JSON** — resets the JSON to default values
- Pressing **Close** will *not* apply changes in this tab
