# Graphs & Tables

Discover the graphs and tables included in the Dashboard. This page explains how each visualization works, the data it represents, and the filtering or interaction options available.

## Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a high-level summary of all test runs across projects. It consists of special sections and a statistics graph. The visibility of each element can be controlled via [Settings - Overview Tab](/settings#overview-settings-overview-tab).

### Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Latest Runs** | Displays the most recent run for each project as a card. Each card shows pass/fail/skip counts and duration, color-coded to indicate performance relative to previous runs. Clicking a project card filters the Overview to that project. |
| **Total Stats** | Shows aggregate statistics across all runs grouped by project: total passed, failed, skipped runs, average duration, and average pass rate. |

### Graphs

| Graph Name          | Views       | Views Description                                                                                                | Notes |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Run Donut           | Percentages | Displays the distribution of passed, failed, skipped tests per run.                                              | -     |

### Display Toggles

The Overview page supports several display toggles (configured in [Settings - Overview Tab](/settings#overview-settings-overview-tab)):

| Toggle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Projects by Name** | Groups runs by their project name. |
| **Projects by Tag** | Groups runs by `project_` tags instead of name. See [Project Tagging](/advanced-cli-examples#project-tagging). |
| **Prefixes** | Shows or hides the `project_` prefix text on tag-based names. |
| **Percentage Filters** | Enables the duration percentage threshold control for color-coding. |
| **Version Filters** | Enables per-project version filtering with checkbox selectors. |
| **Sort Filters** | Enables sort controls on the Overview page. |

## Graph Switch Persistence

Many graphs include toggle switches and dropdown filters (e.g. *Ignore Skips*, *Only Last Run*, *Only Failed Tests*, *Status*, *Only Changes*, *Hour*). All of these graph-level switches are **automatically saved to localStorage** and restored when the dashboard is reopened. This means your per-graph preferences are remembered across browser sessions without any manual action.

The persisted graph switches include:

| Switch | Graph(s) | Default |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Ignore Skips** | Test Most Flaky | Off |
| **Ignore Skips** | Test Recent Most Flaky | Off |
| **Only Failed Tests** | Suite Folder Donut | Off |
| **Only Last Run** | Suite Most Time-Consuming | Off |
| **Only Last Run** | Test Most Time-Consuming | Off |
| **Only Last Run** | Keyword Most Time-Consuming | Off |
| **Only Last Run** | Keyword Most Used | Off |
| **Only Changes** | Test Statistics | Off |
| **Status** | Test Statistics | All |
| **Only Changes** | Compare Tests | Off |
| **Status** | Compare Tests | All |
| **Status** | Run Heatmap | All |
| **Hour** | Run Heatmap | All |
| **Suite Paths** | Suite Statistics | Off |
| **Suite Paths** | Test Statistics | Off |
| **Suite Paths** | Compare Tests | Off |

These switches are stored alongside the other dashboard settings and can also be viewed or edited via the [JSON Settings tab](/settings#json-settings-json-tab) under the `switch` key.

## Tooltips

Many graphs include enhanced tooltips that display additional information when hovering over data points:

- **Run Statistics & Run Duration**: Tooltips show total run duration and pass/fail/skip status.
- **Suite Statistics & Suite Duration**: Tooltips show suite duration and pass/fail/skip status.
- **Test Statistics (Timeline)**: Tooltips show the run label, test status, duration, and failure messages (if any).
- **Test Statistics (Line)**: Tooltips show the test name, status, run start, duration, and failure messages.
- **Test Duration**: Tooltips show the test status and failure messages.
- **Compare Tests**: Tooltips show the run label, test status, duration, and failure messages.

These enhanced tooltips make it easier to understand test results without needing to navigate to individual log files.
